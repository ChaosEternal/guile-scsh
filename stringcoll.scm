;;; A string collector is a data structure that reduces the overhead of
;;; accumulating a large string in bits and pieces. It is basically a 
;;; "chunk list," where a chunk is a string of at least 128 chars. In this
;;; way, the list overhead is kept under 2% of the whole data structure.
;;; When a new string is added to the collection, it is added to the current
;;; chunk. When the chunk reaches 128 chars, it is added to the chunk list,
;;; and a new chunk is started. If a large string is added to the collection, 
;;; it is added as a chunk itself, so large strings are not split into small 
;;; pieces. (Actually, a *copy* of the original large string is saved as a 
;;; single chunk, so the collector's chunks are not shared with client data.)
;;;
;;; MAKE-STRING-COLLECTOR allocates a new string collector data structure.
;;; COLLECT-STRING! appends a string to the current collection.
;;; CLEAR-STRING-COLLECTOR! clears out accumulated strings from a collector.
;;; STRING-COLLECTOR->STRING converts a collector into a contiguous string.
;;;
;;; This facility makes it reasonably efficient to accumulate strings
;;; of any size in increments of any size.

;;; ----------------------
;;; S is a string. Append it to the string being collected in the
;;; string-collector SC.
;;;
;;; The algorithm:
;;; First, do nothing if S is the empty string. Otherwise:
;;; If there is a current chunk:
;;;    Copy characters from S into it.
;;;    If we filled up the chunk
;;;        Put the chunk on the chunk list.
;;;        Look at the remaining chars from S we haven't copied yet.
;;;        If there a lot of characters left (>= 128)
;;;            Save them as a single chunk on the chunk list.
;;;            No current chunk.
;;;	   Else if there a just a few characters left (> 0, < 128)
;;;            Start a new current chunk, copy the chars left into it.
;;;        Else if there aren't any characters left
;;;            No current chunk.
;;;
;;; If there is no current chunk:
;;;     If there are a lot of characters in S (>= 128)
;;;         Save a copy of S as a single chunk on the chunk list.
;;;         Still no current chunk.
