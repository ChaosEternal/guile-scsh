This is a pre alpha software, use it on your own risk. The most noteworthy
problem is that it's not kind to though who types in errors, the failures
are so badly handled that it can ruin the enclosing shell. But on the other 
hand it can demo some of the features in the original scsh quite well.

To use it.

1. add this directory to guile's %load-path

2. use a module in the scsh directory that export a feature you would like to use

3. use it (prefereable correctly without errors or there will be dragons)

Example:
scheme@(guile-user)> (use-modules (scsh syntax))
scheme@(guile-user)> (& (| (ls) (grep COP)))
$4 = #{proc 3084}
scheme@(guile-user)> COPYING
